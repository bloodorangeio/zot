# Build and install binary (using host's toolchain)

```
go get -u github.com/anuvu/zot/cmd/zot
```

# Full CI/CD Build

* Build inside a container (preferred)

```
make binary-container
```

* Alternatively, build inside a container using [stacker](https://github.com/anuvu/stacker) (preferred)

```
make binary-stacker
```

* Build using host's toolchain

```
make

```

Build artifacts are in bin/

# Serving
```
bin/zot serve _config-file_
```

Examples of config files are available in [examples/](examples/) dir.

# Compliance checks

```
bin/zot compliance -H host [-V "all"] [--json]
```

# Ecosystem

## skopeo

[skopeo](https://github.com/containers/skopeo) is a tool to work with remote
image repositories.

We have a [patched version](https://github.com/anuvu/skopeo) available that
works with _zot_.

```
git clone https://github.com/anuvu/skopeo

cd skopeo

make GO111MODULE=on binary-local
```

## cri-o

[cri-o](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o) is a OCI-based Kubernetes container
runtime interface.

We have a [patched version](https://github.com/anuvu/image) of containers/image
available that works with _zot_ which must be linked with cri-o.

```
git clone https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o

cd cri-o

echo 'replace github.com/containers/image => github.com/anuvu/image v1.5.2-0.20190827234748-f71edca6153a' >> go.mod

make bin/crio crio.conf GO111MODULE=on

```

# Caveats

* go 1.12+
* The OCI distribution spec is still WIP, and we try to keep up
